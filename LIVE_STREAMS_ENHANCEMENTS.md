## How Each Feature Works Together

### Stream Lifecycle:
1. **Before Start Time**: Stream appears in "Upcoming" with countdown timer and "Remind Me" option
2. **15 Minutes Before**: Automated system sends reminders (if configured)
3. **Goes Live**: Stream automatically moves to "Live Now" section with red indicator
4. **During Stream**: Viewer count increments as users join
5. **After End**: Stream moves to "Past Streams" with "Watch Replay" button

### User Interactions:
1. **Search**: Type to filter all streams across current tab
2. **Switch Tabs**: Clear search, show relevant streams with counts
3. **Set Reminder**: Save to database, show confirmation, update UI
4. **Join Stream**: Increment viewer count, open URL, refresh display
5. **Refresh**: Pull down, click header button, or wait 30s for auto-refresh

## Database Integration

All features are fully connected to Supabase:

- **livestreams table**: Stores all stream data
- **stream_reminders table**: Tracks user reminders
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Instant updates on changes
