## 🚫 What's NOT Included (and Why)

### No Text Overlays
**Why?** Post screen already has caption field. Add text there instead.

**Benefits:**

- Faster editing experience
- Text is editable even after posting
- Consistent with other social apps

### No Drawing Tools
**Why?** Keep editor focused on essential photo editing.

**Alternative:** Use your phone's built-in photo editor for drawings, then import.

**Future:** May add sticker library based on user feedback.
